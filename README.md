# Numerical-Calculation-Java
In this project we cope with a great number of root finding problebs. In Java we can solve these types of equation. Also you can solve other equations by changing the equation implemented in this program. 
# Bisection_Method
Implementing functional references and solve a numerical problem in Java. In this project, I solved a root finding problem using the Bisection method. By running this project, you can see the operation of this program that can solve different problems truly.
